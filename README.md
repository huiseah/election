==ABOUT AUSVOTES

	AusVotes was born out of the desire to understand and visualise the Australian polling data for the 2013 Federal election. We wanted to make it easy for people to see a visual representation of the current polling data.

	Our goal is to help people understand who the candidates are and what the latest polling data is revealing to the public.

==PRINCIPLES
An experimental approach to UX. We wanted to disrupt the hegemonic legacy of binding functionality to buttons. It is through indoctrination via habitualisation that buttons for example gain the aura of 'correctness'. We felt an approach of embedded functionality within images, maps and text would be more intuitive. The degrees of success or failure of which we may be judged by will thus depend on how intuitively a user discovers further functionality beyond the text, images and maps.
