==ABOUT AUSVOTES

	AusVotes was born out of the desire to understand and visualise the Australian polling data for the 2013 Federal election. We wanted to make it easy for people to see a visual representation of the current polling data.

	Our goal is to help people understand who the candidates are and what the latest polling data is revealing to the public.
